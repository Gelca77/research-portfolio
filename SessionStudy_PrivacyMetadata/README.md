# Privacy & Metadata in Encrypted Messaging (Session Study)

**Summary**  
This project examined Session, an end-to-end encrypted messaging application designed to minimize metadata and enhance privacy. The study analyzed Session’s cryptographic design, onion routing, swarm algorithms, and metadata protection strategies, comparing its approach to more conventional messengers like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. The findings highlight how Session’s decentralized architecture and layered encryption enhance anonymity and resilience against surveillance.  

**Motivation**  
I pursued this project to understand how cryptographic protocols and metadata minimization can strengthen privacy in communication systems. The goal was to evaluate how design decisions in encryption and routing directly affect user security, anonymity, and trust in messaging platforms.  

**Takeaways**  
- **Technical Knowledge**: Gained deeper insight into onion routing, swarm algorithms, Signal protocol, Perfect Forward Secrecy, and deniable authentication.  
- **Research Skills**: Compared Session’s decentralized approach with centralized messaging services, highlighting trade-offs in scalability and resilience.  
- **Security Perspective**: Learned how metadata, which often is overlooked compared to message content, can pose significant privacy risks when not adequately protected.  

**Future Connections**  
This project shaped my understanding of how cryptographic protections intersect with user trust and human behavior. Metadata, though invisible to users, can reveal patterns exploitable in social engineering and surveillance. For my PhD vision, this study provides a foundation for designing **AI/NLP-driven defenses against manipulation tactics**, where protecting metadata and communication integrity is as crucial as detecting malicious content. By bridging technical defenses with human-centered vulnerabilities, I aim to create more resilient systems that defend both infrastructure and the people they serve.

# Adult Temperament, Lesbian Identity & Partner Preferences

**Summary**  
This study investigated whether temperament influences how lesbian women identify themselves (e.g., femme, stud, butch) and their partner preferences, while also examining the role of ethnicity. Survey data from 44 participants showed that temperament had no significant effect, but results revealed meaningful links between ethnicity and identity terms as well as between identity and partner preferences.  

**Motivation**  
I pursued this project to explore how innate traits (temperament) and cultural/social factors shape identity and attraction within the lesbian community. Understanding these influences provides insight into the intersection of psychology, identity, and diversity, especially where culture and personal labels overlap.  

**Takeaways**  
- **Research Design Skills**: Conducted survey research, applied the EAS Temperament Scale, and used Chi-Square analysis to test relationships between variables.  
- **Findings**:  
  - Temperament showed no effect on identity or partner preference.  
  - Ethnicity significantly influenced identity terms (i.e., African American participants often identified as stud, femme, or soft stud).  
  - Partner identity and preferences were strongly linked (i.e., studs/butch participants preferred femme partners).  
- **Critical Reflection**: Learned how sampling, SES representation, and measurement tools can limit generalizability, while also seeing how cultural context matters in identity research.  

**Future Connections**  
This project deepened my appreciation of human identity and labeling as both personal and cultural constructs. For my PhD vision, it reinforces the idea that human behavior and self-perception directly affect vulnerability and resilience. Just as identity labels reflect cultural and psychological dynamics, in cybersecurity, user decisions and biases shape how people respond to manipulation tactics like phishing or social engineering. This experience supports my broader research direction of developing **AI/NLP-driven defenses** that account for human diversity and behavioral factors when modeling deception and trust.

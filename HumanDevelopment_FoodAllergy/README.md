# Early Food Exposure & Allergy Risk

**Summary**  
This study explored whether introducing solid foods to infants earlier than pediatric guidelines recommend increases the risk of developing food allergies later in childhood. Survey data from 22 parents indicated that children whose parents followed medical guidance on food introduction were less likely to experience allergic reactions.  

**Motivation**  
I pursued this project to better understand how early-life environmental exposures influence health outcomes, particularly allergies. I wanted to test the hypothesis that parental feeding practices may directly contribute to childrenâ€™s food sensitivities.  

**Takeaways**  
- Gained experience designing and administering surveys, analyzing responses, and applying statistical tests (t-test).  
- Learned the importance of sample size and population diversity in producing generalizable results.  
- Identified how limitations such as socioeconomic status (SES) bias and low participant numbers can shape conclusions.  

**Future Connections**  
This project gave me foundational exposure to how human behavior (parental decision-making) interacts with health risks. The lessons translate to my PhD vision by reinforcing how human choices can create or mitigate vulnerabilities in larger systems. Just as feeding practices can influence immune outcomes, user behaviors and biases play a critical role in cybersecurity. My future research will extend this behavioral focus into **AI- and NLP-driven defenses against social engineering attacks**, where understanding human factors is key to designing resilient systems.

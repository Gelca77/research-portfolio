##Project Pisces: SOC Threat Analysis & Cross-Training

##Summary
This capstone project documents my experience as a Tier 1 analyst with Project PISCES (Public Infrastructure Security Cyber Education System) and my cross-training in a professional Information Security Office. Through live SOC work, I investigated alerts ranging from poor reputation IPs to malware and command injection exploits (i.e., CVE-2023-26801), generating tickets that protected critical infrastructure partners across Colorado

##Motivation
I pursued this project to gain hands-on SOC analyst experience in real-world environments. Project PISCES gave me exposure to defending public infrastructure serving over 500,000 residents, while cross-training professionally deepened my understanding of credential compromises, malware investigations, device theft, and phishing/social engineering attacks.

##Takeaways
•	Technical Skills: Developed expertise in SIEM tools (Kibana), IP/domain analysis (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault, Cisco Talos), malware investigation (Nessus, Defender, sandboxing), and vulnerability research (CVE, CVSS, CWE, NVD).
•	Analyst Practices: Learned incident response workflows including credential resets, device encryption/wipe procedures, phishing containment, and mitigation planning.
•	Recognition: Achieved Analyst of the Month awards (Nov 2023, Jan 2024) and promotion to Tier 1 analyst for consistently exceeding expectations.
•	Human Factors: Observed how employee vigilance (e.g., spotting phishing emails) can make or break an organization’s defenses.

##Future Connections
This project laid the foundation for my PhD vision at the intersection of psychology and cybersecurity. The cross-training reinforced that even advanced technical controls can be weakened by human error or manipulation, which is exactly the vulnerabilities I aim to address. Going forward, I will extend these experiences into research on AI and NLP driven defenses against social engineering, building automated systems that detect and counter manipulation tactics much like SOC analysts investigate and escalate threats.
